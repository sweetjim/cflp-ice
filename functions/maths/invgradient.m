%INVGRADIENT Basically the opposite of gradient(), aka Inverse Gradient.
%   F_bar = INVGRADIENT(dFx,dFy) reverses GRADIENT(F), where unit  
%   spacing is assumed.
%   F_bar = INVGRADIENT(dFx,dFy,H), where H is scalar, uses H as the
%   spacing between points.
%   F_bar = INVGRADIENT(dFx,dFy,Hx,Hy) is basically the same, except that
%   both x- and y-spacings are specified.
%   Obviously, the DC offset of the integrated function is arbitrary. Also,
%   INVGRADIENT is limited to 2-dimensions at the moment, ie no
%   3-dimensional matrices, or vectors. If dFx and dFy aren't
%   self-consistent then no exact solution can be integrated. In this case
%   the optimal solution, in the least squares sense, will be found. So 
%   if you do F_bar = INVGRADIENT(dFx,dFy), F_bar will be found such that 
%   doing [dFx_ dFy_] = GRADIENT(F_bar) will give you dFx_ and dFy_ that 
%   are as close as possible to the original dFx and dFy.
