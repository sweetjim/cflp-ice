%DIC_DISPFIELD Use digitial image correlation (DIC) to find the displacement
%field that warps Iref into Idef.
%
% SYNOPSIS: [u,v,br,bc,corr_qual] = dic_dispfield(Iref,Idef,blockspacing,borderoverlap,maxdisp,...)
%
% INPUT Iref: Reference image, to be sliced up in template blocks
%       Idef: Distorted image, to be sliced up in search window blocks
%       blockspacing: Grid spacing between consecutive points for which 
%                     displacement vectors are found
%       borderoverlap: Number of pixels each template block extends (on all 
%                      sides) beyond the grid spacing (block overlap) 
%                      (template_width = blockspacing + 2*borderoverlap)
%       maxdisp: maximum vert/hor displacement within which to search for 
%                a match between each template and search window
%                (search window width = template_width + 2*maxdisp)
%       refinedisp: (optional, for warping schemes) replace maxdisp by 
%                   refinedisp < maxdisp, but keep the block coordinates 
%                   (offset from top and left image border) as they were, 
%                   set to [] if not needed.
%       minqual: (default: 0.01) vectors with a correlation quality lower 
%                than minqual will be disregarded (set to NaN). 
%       normcorr: (default: true) use normalized cross correlation 
%                 (if set to false, basic cross correlation is used)
%       wgt: (optional) weight matrix of size(Iref) to take into account in
%            the normalized cross corelation (e.g. for masked regions)
%            (Padfield 2010, Masked FFT Registration, IEEE CVPR Conference)
%
% OUTPUT u: displacement in x (along columns, left to right) direction
%        v: displacement in y (along rows, top to bottom) direction
%        br: y (row) coord. of (u,v) vector (centered on template blocks)
%        bc: x (col) coord. of (u,v) vector (centered on template blocks)
%        corr_qual: correlation quality for each vector
