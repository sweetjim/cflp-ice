# DICflow
Digital image correlation (DIC) and optical flow (OF) toolkit for Synthetic Schlieren imaging

# Usage
For all functions to work properly the scripts in sub-directory **./general** should be on your MATLAB path. Usage examples are found in the **./examples** sub-directory. Type `help functionname` on the MATLAB prompt for function specific usage info (or see the comments inside the function file).
